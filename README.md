# WellnessQuests

**WellnessQuests** is an Android application that combines physical and mental health with game mechanics. Users complete quests, collect coins, and progress through an interactive level-based map. The application is developed in Android Studio using Java and follows the MVVM architecture pattern with DataBinding, LiveData, and Firebase integration.

This submission corresponds to tag **v4.0**, which includes quest verification via ML Kit, a dynamic level system, sound-effects, music, and improved project structure for evaluation.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication**: Register and log in with email and password
- **Cloud Firestore**: Coins, level data, and quest status are saved in the cloud
- **DataBinding and LiveData**: UI elements update in real-time as data changes
- **Quest system**: Each quest contains:
- Title, description, and category (e.g., "Mind", "Fitness")
- Coin reward
- A list of valid image tags for verification

- **ML Kit Integration**:  
  During quest verification, users upload or capture a photo. ML Kit analyzes the image locally and compares it to the expected tags. If matching, the quest is automatically marked as complete.

- **Interactive Level Map**:  
  Each level contains 8 quests. Users unlock levels using coins and can tap each level node to view information.  
  

- **Offline support**:  
  Basic functionality such as quest display and UI navigation may work offline **after login**, but the app **requires an internet connection to log in** and to sync data with Firestore. Offline support is limited and not fully implemented in this version
